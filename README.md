## About
The fashion sector was responsible for about 2.1 billion metric tons of greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions in 2018, which is 4 percent of the global total. For context,  this means it emits about the same quantity of GHGs per year as the **entire economies of France, Germany, and the United Kingdom combined**. - [McKinsey Research](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/fashion-on-climate)
