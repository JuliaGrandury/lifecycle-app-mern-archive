# Lifecycle App

## About
The fashion sector was responsible for about 2.1 billion metric tons of greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions in 2018, which is 4 percent of the global total. For context,  this means it emits about the same quantity of GHGs per year as the **entire economies of France, Germany, and the United Kingdom combined**. - [McKinsey Research](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/fashion-on-climate)

Built this app to help users with their closet organization and keep track of what they own in order to avoid unnecessary purchases.
I also built it in the hopes of encouraging swaps and exchanges of clothing between friends and family.
Absence makes the heart grow fonder and sometimes that is all we need to want to wear an item again.

TLDR; I built this app to help users track the items in their closet and encourage clothes swaps or exchanges in hopes of fighting unnecessary consumption.

## Roadmap
- [ ] add variable in Closet Item Schema for if it's broken
- [ ] add item categories for sorting
- [ ] add random creation of outfits
- [ ] add swap or borrow requests
- [ ] add wishlist
